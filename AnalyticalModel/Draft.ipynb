    "- this is a jupyter notebook\n",
    "- it consists of text cells (like the cell you're reading right now) and code cells\n",
    "  - the code cells are written in the python programming language\n",
    "- you can execute a cell by\n",
    "  - clicking into it and pressing Shift + Enter or\n",
    "  - klicking the \"play\" symbol at the top\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making changes\n",
    "- Unfortunately, any changes you make to this notebook will NOT be saved when closing it\n",
    "- The easiest solution is to copy the code you write to a .txt-file (Word might destroy the formatting) and paste it when you continue working\n",
    "\n",
    "## The other files\n",
    "- Clicking the folder icon on the left will open (surprise) the folder that this notebook lives in\n",
    "- the other file *doublet.py* contains the equations used in this notebook.\n",
    "  - you can do this entire exercise without looking into *doublet.py*\n",
    "  - but feel free to open it and explore\n",
    "  - Since nothing is saved, even if you break something, you can simply open the link in a fresh window\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trouble shooting\n",
    "- if you changed something\n",
    "- and for some reason, the result is the same as before. Or not what you think it should be:\n",
    "- Sometimes the Notebook remembers something it should not remember -> Try right clicking into a cell and choose *Restart Kernel*\n",
